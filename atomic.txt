Implementation Strategy

Start with Dashboard, as it provides the foundation for navigation and user engagement.
Next, build out New Analysis, since itâ€™s a core feature of your app.
Follow up with Generated Questions to display results from analyses.
Develop the Chat Interface last, as it can leverage functionalities from the previous sections.
If time permits, consider adding User Profile and Help/Support Page for a more complete user experience.
